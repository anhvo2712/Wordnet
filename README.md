Overview
A project which explores how the volume of printed works in English has changed over time, as well as the structure of the is-a relationships of words.

Description
Wordnet is a lexical database for the English language
It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets, provides short, general definitions, and records the various semantic relations between these synonym sets
For this project, I created a graphical representation of this mapping along with a graphing mechanism to see how word popularity changes over time
Skills
Java programming
Requires designing graph structures for efficient data handling
Emphasizes independent design decisions
Parsing large datasets
